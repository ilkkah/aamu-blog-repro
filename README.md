Gatsby [Aamu.app](https://aamu.app) starter for creating a blog

![The index page of the starter blog](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AamuApp/gatsby-aamu-starter/master/screenshot.jpg "The index page of the starter blog")

If you want to use try this out yourself, you first need to set up a project on Aamu.app which will host your data. 

See the demo site here: **[DEMO](https://gatsby-aamu-starter.netlify.com/)**

Static sites are scalable, secure and have very little required maintenance. They come with a drawback though. Not everybody feels good editing files, building a project and uploading it somewhere. This is where Aamu.app comes into play.

With Aamu.app and Gatsby you can connect your favorite static site generator with an API that provides an easy to use interface for people writing content and automate the publishing using services like [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/) or [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

## Features

* Simple content model and structure. Easy to adjust to your needs.
* Responsive/adaptive images via [gatsby-image](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-image/)

# Installation

### Create an Aamu.app account

To use this website, you need an [Aamu.app](https://aamu.app/) account. Create one/log into your account and then create a database from the template **gatsby-aamu-starter**:

After that, you need an **API key**. Go to database settings for your newly created database and create an API key. Copy-paste that to somewhere safe.

### Deployment to Netlify

You can use this repository on Netlify. After creating an Aamu.app database, click this.
