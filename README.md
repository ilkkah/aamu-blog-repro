# aamu-blog

Gatsby sources for [Aamu.app blog](https://blog.aamu.app).

If you want to try this out yourself, you first need to set up a project on Aamu.app which will host your data. 

# Installation

### Create an Aamu.app account

To use this website, you need an [Aamu.app](https://aamu.app/) account. Create one/log into your account and then create a database from the template **gatsby-aamu-starter**: 

After that, you need an **API key**. Go to database settings for your newly created database and create an API key. Copy-paste that to somewhere safe.

### Deployment to Netlify

You can use this repository on Netlify. After creating an Aamu.app database, click this:

[![Deploy to Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/img/deploy/button.svg)](https://app.netlify.com/start/deploy?repository=https://github.com/AamuApp/aamu-blog)

Netlify will ask your permission to clone this repository â€” First click *Connect to GitHub*, then click *Authorize*. 

You will be then taken to a page which asks your *secret token*. Enter your API key here. 

Submit the form and Netlify will start building your site. This cloned repository will be on your GitHub account.

#### Common Netlify errors
